Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) is a program presented by Google Developers. GDSCs are university based community groups for students. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.

## Background

GDSC launched in 2017 as a pilot in India to help solve the challenges that university graduates were facing securing employment in the tech industry. We aimed to provide students with the resources, opportunities, and experience necessary to be industry ready, all while still pursuing their degrees. Since then, the program grew to Indonesia and Africa. This year we are growing globally. From Asia to Africa; Europe, Japan, Middle East, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, and North America- GDSCs are training thousands of student developers and working with their communities to solve real-life problems. Check out some of our stories to learn more. We are currently in over 1500+ universities across the globe in 100+ countries!
