# Code of Conduct

## Be nice.

We're all part of the same community, so be friendly, be welcoming, and generally be a nice person. Be someone that other people want to be around.

We want the platform to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldnâ€™t demean others.

## Be respectful and constructive.

We're a diverse group, so we're not going to agree all the time. Assume positive intent. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

Remember to be respectful and constructive with your communication to your fellow organizers, harassment is not tolerated. Don't get into flame wars, don't make personal attacks, don't vent or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a potential flamewar or negative thread as early as possible.

## Be collaborative.

Work together! We can learn a lot from each other. Share knowledge, respond to posts, help each other out.
